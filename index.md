## Biography
- 2018-present Senior Researcher in Department of Anti-money Laundering and Riskmanagement, Tencent
- 2018-2018 Postdoc Research Fellow in Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)
- 2013-2018 Ph. D. in Information Engineering, CUHK
- 2011-2013 Bachelor of Enigneering in Information Enigneering, CUHK 
- 2009-2011 Bachelor of Science in Electronical Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University

I received the B.Eng. degree (with first class Hons.) and the Ph.D degree in information engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2013 and 2018, respectively. My research interests include network embedding, optimization theory, queueing analysis, dynamic programming, deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithm in Smart Grid. I'm currently a Senior Researcher on NLP, Multimodal Learning, and GNN for Wechat Pay risk management with Tencent, Shenzhen, China.
